# Clustering


Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that involves grouping sets of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. 
In essence, clustering in unsupervised learning is about finding natural groupings in data, which can provide meaningful insights but also comes with challenges in terms of subjectivity and interpretation.

### Purpose:

- Objective: To discover the inherent grouping in the data.

- Application: Used in many fields like market research, pattern recognition, image analysis, and bioinformatics.

### Key Characteristics

- No Labels: Works with unlabeled data; the algorithm identifies clusters based on data features.

- Similarity Measures: Relies on measures of similarity or distance (like Euclidean distance) to group data points.

## Common Clustering Algorithms:

   1. K-Means Clustering: Partitions data into K number of distinct clusters based on distance to the centroid of a cluster.

   2. Hierarchical Clustering: Builds a hierarchy of clusters by progressively merging or splitting existing groups.
  
   3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): Forms clusters based on the density of data points in a region, good for data with noise and outliers.
